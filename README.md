FakeStore is my process of learning the Angular framework. It is still under development but already has working functionality that I will add while learning Angular


<h3>The common functionalities are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The user can see all the products</li>
<li>The user can see detailed description of the product</li>
<li>The user can add the products to cart (it stays in localstorage)</li>
<li>The user can see the card</li>
<li>The cart will calculate the total cost of the items in it</li>
<li>The user can confirm the purchase if there is at least one product in the cart, but it will be sent to the void!  </li>
</ul>

I am using the <a href="https://my-json-server.typicode.com/">my-json-server</a> and my fakeStoreAPI to get product list.

<h3>Build with</h3>
<ul>
